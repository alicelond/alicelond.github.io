The [Common Weakness Enumeration](https://cwe.mitre.org/about/index.html) is a list of vulnerabilities of software, firmware and hardware developed by the community. These weaknesses are conditions in a given component which can under certain cirscumstances introduce vulnerabilities. They partner with academia, industry, and government wishing to eliminate these weaknesses before deployment, where they are cheaper to solve in the product lifecycle.

The [5 most common vulnerabilities](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2024/2024_cwe_top25.html) in software programs in 2024 was the following. Being aware of these aspects can offer insight into common root causes, 

## Improper neutralisation of input during web page generation
