### Project: Automated Monitoring System
- Description: Designed and implemented a system to collect and analyse embedded systems data, reducing manual tasks by over 72 minutes daily.
- Technologies: Python, bash, SQL
- Key features and metrics: Reduced manual tasks of the engineering team by 72 minutes daily, built a JSON parser.

### Project: Vibration-Based Train Speed Estimation using Machine Learning
- Description: Used machine learning to estimate train velocity using vibration signals captured by accelerometers. 
- Technologies: Scikit-learn, Scipy, Librosa, Pandas, Numpy
- Key features and metrics: Achieved a 45% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to the baseline, from 10.85 km/h to 5.93 km/h, and engineered 42 features from raw vibration data.
