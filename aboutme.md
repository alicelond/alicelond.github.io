subtitle: From sound waves to software engineering
---
Hello there, I'm Alice Becker Londero, an acoustical and software engineer with a passion for building software that bring solutions connecting the physical and digital worlds. Currently, I'm a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of São Paulo (USP), where I focus on digital processing techniques to process vibration data on real-time systems.

As someone that is led by curiosity, my profissional carrer has been driven by experimentation where I worked in different fields in Acoustical Engineering, which include room acoustics, building acoustics, environmental acoustics and digital signal processing. A common factor in all these experiences was that I always looked for challenges and used code to ease processes which has lead me to software engineering. 

By increasing my computing skills, I was able to build code and solve problems that helped other people understand better complex physical systems, which has amazed me. On this blog, "From signal to software," I document what intrigues me: from how engineering devices from our daily lives are made, what I learn from the world of software engineering and reflections from the tech topics that affects everyone that work in this field.

### Let's Connect
I'm always excited to connect with fellow engineers, developers, and anyone passionate about technology. If my work and experience resonate with you, I'd love to chat.
