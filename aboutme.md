| Hi, I'm Alice Becker Londero, an engineer with a passion for building software that bridges the physical and digital worlds. | ![Alice Becker Londero](/assets/img/pixel_small.png) |
|---|---|
| Currently, I'm a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of São Paulo (USP), where I focus on digital processing techniques to process vibration data on real-time systems. |  |
| My background is in Acoustical Engineering, a field where I learned to translate complex physical phenomena—like sound and vibration—into structured data. I discovered my true passion: not just collecting the data, but building the software that brings it to life. |  |
| I realized that the most elegant solutions to complex engineering challenges lay in code. This realization drove me to pivot my career and pursue a deep, formal education in computer science. |  |

On this blog, "Signal to Software," I document my journey—sharing what I learn about software development, machine learning, and the fascinating problems that can be solved when different fields of engineering come together.

### Let's Connect
I'm always excited to connect with fellow engineers, developers, and anyone passionate about technology. If my work and experience resonate with you, I'd love to chat.
